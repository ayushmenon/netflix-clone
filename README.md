Netflix Clone

In this project I cloned the front-end of Netflix using React, populating the view with data fetched from the TMDB API. 

This project has the additional functionality that when you click on a movie its trailer will open and begin playing. To do so, I made use of the react-youtube component, however some movies do not have their trailers readily available so no trailer will load for those movies when clicked.

This project is deployed using Firebase at: https://netflix-clone-cc73e.web.app
